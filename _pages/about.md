I'm a CS undergrad passionate about solving problems and building things with technology. Developing expertise in Robotics and Machine Intelligence (AI/ML/RL). 

Completed three internships -- one at IIT Madras Research Park under `Dr. Ashok Jhunjhunwala` and another with the e-Yantra team in IIT Bombay led by `Dr. Kavi Arya`. Selected for the latter after winning the Runner-up prize at IIT Bombay's `e-Yantra Robotics Competition 2023` for our `Self-balancing Delivery Bike`. Product of liberal education. Love wildlife and sports - especially Football!

My motivation to pursue Engineering and Science stems from my lifelong pursuit to understand the “what”, “how” and “why” of the world around. Fundamentally, this makes me a “builder”. As Richard Feynman puts it so incisively, “*What I cannot build, I do not understand*.”

<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
