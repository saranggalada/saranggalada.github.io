I'm a CS undergrad passionate about solving problems and building things with technology. Striving to develop expertise in Robotics and Machine Intelligence.

Completed three internships -- one at IIT Madras Research Park under Dr. Ashok Jhunjhunwala and another with the e-Yantra team in IIT Bombay led by Dr. Kavi Arya. Selected for the latter after winning the 3rd-place prize at IIT Bombay's e-Yantra Robotics Competition 2023 for our Self-balancing Delivery Bike. Product of liberal education. Love wildlife and sports - especially Football!

My motivation to pursue Engineering and Science stems from my lifelong pursuit to understand the “what”, “how” and “why” of the universe. Fundamentally, this makes me an “engineer”. As Richard Feynman puts it so incisively, “What I cannot build, I do not understand.”
